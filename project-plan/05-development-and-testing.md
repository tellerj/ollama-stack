# 05: Development and Testing Strategy

This document outlines non-functional requirements and development practices to ensure the CLI tool is robust, supportable, and of high quality.

### 1. Testing and Validation Strategy

- **Principle**: The tool's correctness will be verified through an automated testing suite to ensure that new features or bug fixes do not break existing functionality.
- **Implementation**:
    - **Unit Tests**:
        - `pytest` will be the testing framework.
        - The `unittest.mock` library will be used to simulate external dependencies (e.g., Docker API, file system interactions), allowing for testing logic in isolation.
        - Tests will be located in a top-level `tests/` directory.
    - **Integration Tests**:
        - A separate test suite will run CLI commands against a live, local Docker daemon.
        - These tests will validate the end-to-end functionality of commands, confirming that the correct Docker resources are created and managed.

### 2. Diagnostics and Environment Validation

- **Principle**: The tool must provide a dedicated command to help users diagnose their environment and validate that all requirements are met. This prevents confusing runtime failures and reduces the support burden.
- **Implementation**:
    - **`check` Command**: The `ollama-stack check` command is the primary tool for this purpose.
    - **Checks Performed**: The command will validate and report on:
        - Docker daemon availability.
        - `docker compose` plugin availability and version.
        - NVIDIA Container Toolkit presence (on Linux).
        - Connectivity to required image registries (e.g., Docker Hub).
    - **Installation Scripts**: The `install.sh` and `install.ps1` scripts will perform a minimal check for a compatible Python version and `pip` before attempting to install the CLI.

### 3. Logging and Debuggability

- **Principle**: The tool must provide a mechanism for users and developers to get detailed diagnostic information when troubleshooting issues.
- **Implementation**:
    - **Rich Logging**: The `rich` library will be used to implement a handler for Python's standard `logging` module, providing clear, color-coded output.
    - **Logging Levels**: Standard levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`) will be used.
    - **Global `--verbose` Flag**: A global `--verbose` flag will control the output verbosity.
    - **Default Output**: Displays `INFO` level and higher.
    - **Verbose Output**: Displays `DEBUG` level and higher, providing detailed diagnostics for troubleshooting and bug reports.
