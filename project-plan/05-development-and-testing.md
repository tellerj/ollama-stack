# 05: Development and Testing Strategy

This document outlines the development practices and testing strategy that ensure the CLI tool is robust, supportable, and of high quality throughout its phased implementation.

## 1. Testing and Validation Strategy

- **Principle**: The tool's correctness is verified through a comprehensive automated testing suite that ensures new features or bug fixes do not break existing functionality.

### 1.1. Current Implementation âœ… (Phases 1-3)
- **Unit Tests**: 296 tests with 100% pass rate
    - `pytest` framework with extensive mocking using `unittest.mock`
    - Tests simulate external dependencies (Docker API, file system interactions) for isolated testing
    - Located in top-level `tests/` directory with parallel structure to source code
    - Comprehensive coverage of all core modules: main, config, docker_client, stack_manager, etc.
- **Integration Tests**: 11 tests with 100% pass rate
    - Run CLI commands against live, local Docker daemon
    - Validate end-to-end functionality confirming correct Docker resource management
    - Test real service health checking and status reporting
    - 4 tests appropriately skipped when Docker/services unavailable

### 1.2. Future Testing Requirements ðŸ”„ (Phases 5-7)
- **Phase 5 (Resource Management)**: 
    - Unit tests for update orchestration and resource cleanup logic
    - Integration tests for full update and uninstall workflows
    - Safety tests for volume preservation and confirmation prompts
- **Phase 6 (Backup/Migration)**:
    - Unit tests for backup/restore logic with mocked file system operations
    - Integration tests for full backup and restore cycles
    - Migration tests for upgrade paths between versions
- **Phase 7 (Extension Management)**:
    - Unit tests for extension discovery, state management, and lifecycle logic
    - Integration tests for full extension lifecycle (enable â†’ start â†’ stop â†’ disable)
    - Dependency tests for extension dependency resolution and validation

## 2. Diagnostics and Environment Validation âœ… (Implemented)

- **Principle**: The tool provides dedicated commands to help users diagnose their environment and validate that all requirements are met, preventing confusing runtime failures.
- **Current Implementation**:
    - **`check` Command**: Fully implemented as primary diagnostic tool
    - **Checks Performed**: 
        - Docker daemon availability and version
        - Docker Compose plugin availability and version  
        - Port availability (11434, 8080, 8200)
        - Platform-specific requirements:
          - Apple Silicon: Native Ollama installation
          - NVIDIA: Container Toolkit presence
        - Project configuration file validation
    - **Installation Scripts**: `install-ollama-stack.sh` and `install-ollama-stack.ps1` verify Python 3.8+ and pip before installation

## 3. Logging and Debuggability âœ… (Implemented)

- **Principle**: The tool provides comprehensive diagnostic information for troubleshooting issues.
- **Current Implementation**:
    - **Rich Logging**: `rich` library integrated with Python's standard `logging` module for color-coded output
    - **Logging Levels**: Standard levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`) used throughout
    - **Global `--verbose` Flag**: Controls output verbosity across all commands
      - **Default Output**: `INFO` level and higher with clean, user-friendly formatting
      - **Verbose Output**: `DEBUG` level and higher for detailed diagnostics
    - **Consistent Output**: All user-facing output managed through `display.py` module

## 4. Coding Standards and Quality âœ… (Implemented)

- **Principle**: The codebase maintains consistent style and high quality through automated tooling and established practices.
- **Current Implementation**:
    - **Formatter**: `black` for deterministic, non-negotiable code formatting
    - **Linter**: `ruff` catches bugs, style inconsistencies, and quality issues
    - **Configuration**: Settings managed in `pyproject.toml`
    - **Developer Guidelines**: Comprehensive `CONTRIBUTING.md` with:
      - Setup instructions and development workflow
      - Code style requirements and tooling usage
      - Testing standards and procedures
      - Pull request and review process

## 5. Unified Health Check System âœ… (Implemented)

- **Principle**: Service health monitoring must be accurate, consistent, and reliable across all service types.
- **Current Implementation**:
    - **Centralized Logic**: `StackManager` provides unified health checking for all services
    - **HTTP â†’ TCP Fallback**: Robust connectivity testing with graceful degradation
    - **Service-Specific Roles**:
      - `DockerClient`: Container management without health checking
      - `OllamaApiClient`: Rich native service status information
      - `StackManager`: Unified health checks for consistent user experience
    - **Consistent Methodology**: Eliminates discrepancies between Docker health and CLI status

## 6. Definition of Done (Applied Throughout)

- **Principle**: Every feature meets consistent criteria to ensure quality is built into the development process.
- **Current Standard**: A feature is complete when it:
    - Is implemented according to the project's architecture
    - Has passing unit and integration tests
    - Includes clear user-facing documentation (help text, README updates)
    - Adheres to all coding standards (`black`, `ruff` compliance)
    - Is documented in `CHANGELOG.md` for user-facing impact
    - Follows the `AppContext` dependency injection pattern
    - Uses `display.py` for all user output

## 7. Architecture Validation âœ… (Proven)

The v0.2.0 core implementation successfully validates the architectural decisions:

- **AppContext Pattern**: Proven effective for dependency injection and service management
- **StackManager Orchestration**: Central coordination simplifies command implementation
- **Unified Health Checking**: Resolves previous inconsistencies in service status reporting
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns enables maintainable and testable code
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Installation scripts and platform detection work reliably

## 8. Future Development Standards ðŸ”„ (For Upcoming Phases)

### 8.1. Phase 5 (Resource Management) Standards
- **Safety First**: All destructive operations require confirmation prompts unless `--force` specified
- **Progress Reporting**: Long-running operations (image pulls, cleanup) show clear progress
- **Rollback Capability**: Update operations can be safely rolled back if issues occur
- **Resource Discovery**: Automated discovery of stack-related Docker resources by labels

### 8.2. Phase 6 (Backup/Migration) Standards
- **Data Integrity**: All backups include checksums and integrity validation
- **Version Compatibility**: Migration paths defined for all supported version combinations
- **Backup Verification**: Restored configurations validated before marking operation complete
- **Conflict Resolution**: Clear handling of conflicts during restore operations

### 8.3. Phase 7 (Extension Management) Standards
- **Dependency Management**: Extension dependencies checked and validated before operations
- **State Consistency**: Extension state always consistent between registry and runtime
- **Lifecycle Safety**: Extensions cannot be modified while running without explicit stop
- **Compatibility Checking**: Extensions validated against current stack version

## 9. Continuous Quality Assurance

### 9.1. Current Achievements âœ…
- **Test Reliability**: All 307 tests pass consistently across development cycles
- **Code Coverage**: Comprehensive unit test coverage of all critical paths
- **Integration Validation**: Real-world testing ensures Docker operations work correctly
- **User Experience**: Rich formatting and clear error messages provide excellent usability

### 9.2. Ongoing Requirements ðŸ”„
- **Test Growth**: Test suite will expand with each phase, maintaining 100% pass rate
- **Performance Monitoring**: Ensure new commands maintain acceptable performance
- **Documentation Currency**: Keep all documentation synchronized with implementation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with existing configurations and workflows

## 10. Development Workflow

### 10.1. Established Process âœ…
1. **Feature Planning**: Requirements documented in project-plan
2. **Implementation**: Following AppContext and StackManager patterns
3. **Testing**: Unit and integration tests for all features
4. **Documentation**: README, CHANGELOG, and help text updates
5. **Quality Gates**: Black formatting, Ruff linting, test validation

### 10.2. Phase-Specific Considerations ðŸ”„
- **Phase 5**: Focus on Docker operation safety and user confirmation workflows
- **Phase 6**: Emphasis on data integrity and backup validation procedures
- **Phase 7**: Priority on extension compatibility and dependency management

The development strategy ensures that each phase builds upon the solid foundation established in the initial implementation, maintaining the same high standards of quality, testing, and user experience.
