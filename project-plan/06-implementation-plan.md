# 06: Implementation Plan and Status

This document outlines the phased implementation plan for the `ollama-stack` CLI tool, showing completed work and remaining phases.

---

## Current Status: Mid-Implementation (v0.2.0)

The CLI tool is **functionally complete for core operations** and production-ready for basic stack management. Advanced features are planned for future releases.

---

## âœ… Phase 1: Core Lifecycle Commands (COMPLETED)

**Goal:** Implement fundamental commands for managing the core stack lifecycle with platform-aware optimization and health verification.

**Delivered Features:**
- **Project Foundation**: Complete with `pyproject.toml`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`
- **Core Architecture**: All 9 modules implemented:
  - `main.py`: Typer CLI framework with AppContext injection
  - `context.py`: Central dependency injection container
  - `config.py`: Configuration and state management with Pydantic validation
  - `display.py`: Unified Rich-based output formatting
  - `stack_manager.py`: Central orchestration with unified health checking
  - `docker_client.py`: Docker Engine abstraction
  - `ollama_api_client.py`: Native Ollama API integration
  - `schemas.py`: Pydantic data models and service registry
  - `options.py`: Shared CLI utilities

**Implemented Commands:**
- `start`: Platform detection, service startup, health verification
- `stop`: Graceful shutdown preserving data volumes
- `restart`: Full restart with option passthrough

**Testing:** 296 unit tests with comprehensive mocking and validation

**Architecture Achievements:**
- AppContext dependency injection pattern
- StackManager centralized orchestration

### Phase 5.2: Command Implementation
- **`update` Command**:
  - Call `ctx.stack_manager.update_stack()` with service/extension filtering
  - Use `ctx.display` for progress reporting and results
  - Handle running services with user confirmation

- **`uninstall` Command**:
  - Call `ctx.stack_manager.uninstall_stack()` with appropriate flags
  - Use `ctx.display` for warnings, confirmations, and final instructions

### Phase 5.3: Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Mock Docker operations to test orchestration logic
- **Integration Tests**: Test full update and uninstall workflows against live Docker
