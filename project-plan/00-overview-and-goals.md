# 00: Project Overview

## 1. Abstract

This document outlines the plan to replace the current Bash and PowerShell-based CLI scripts with a single, robust, and maintainable tool written in Python.

## 2. The Core Problem

The existing `ollama-stack` and `ollama-stack.ps1` scripts have become difficult to maintain and extend. Key issues include:

- **Dual Maintenance:** All logic must be implemented and tested in two separate, feature-disparate codebases.
- **Fragility:** The scripts rely on parsing the string output of shell commands (`docker`, `grep`, `sed`), which is brittle and error-prone.
- **Inconsistent Behavior:** Divergence between the scripts leads to an inconsistent user experience across platforms.

## 3. The Proposed Solution

We will engineer a single, cross-platform CLI application in Python. This tool will be the authoritative entry point for managing the Ollama Stack lifecycle. It will be built using professional-grade libraries for interacting with Docker and managing its own configuration, and distributed via the standard Python Package Index (PyPI) and `pip`.

## 4. Key Objectives

The success of this refactor is defined by achieving the following objectives:

- **Unified & Maintainable Codebase:** Consolidate all logic into a single Python application. This eliminates code duplication and simplifies future development.
- **API-Driven Robustness:** Replace all shell command parsing with direct, structured interactions with the Docker Engine via its official Python SDK.
- **Platform Consistency:** Ensure that all commands and features behave identically for users on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Standardized Tooling:** Adopt standard, modern Python practices for dependency management (`pyproject.toml`), installation (`pip`), and structured logging.
