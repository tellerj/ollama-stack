# Rule: Data Modeling and State

All data structures and application state are defined using Pydantic models in `schemas.py`.

-   This applies to configuration data (`.env`, `.ollama-stack.json`) and any complex data passed between modules.
-   The `config.py` module is the sole owner and manager of reading/writing the persistent state files (`.env`, `.ollama-stack.json`). Other modules should access configuration through the `AppContext`.
